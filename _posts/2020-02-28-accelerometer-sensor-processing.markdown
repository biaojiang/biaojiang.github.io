## Accelerometer Sensor
[**Accelerometer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) is widely used in machining tool condition monitoring, with proper algorithms, the cutting tool wear and breakage can be detected and predicted. The benefits of tool condition monitoring are:
* Extend the cutting tool life.
* Avoid the workpiece being damaged by the worn tool.

So the manufacturing and economical significance is great.

Another important application of the accelerometer is for towed array sonar, when combined with depth sensor and heading sensor, it is possible to estimate the flexible array manifold, so that the sonar beamforming output SNR can be improved by compensating the array shape distortions.

## Accelerometer Signal Processing

Accelerometer was successfully used in cutting tool breakage detection and prediction, and pure real-time Python algorithm and HMI was developed. 

### Anomaly detection 
Anomaly detection algorithm was developed in Python and verified with real data. 

To be continued!!
