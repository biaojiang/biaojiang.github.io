## Why Turn to Zotero

[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) are two popular reference managing software used to collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research and development work, which can be linked to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Before using Mendeley, I was using [Bibdesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io) and [Jabref](https://www.jabref.org) for a few years, from 2019, I started to use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) to better organising and renaming references. Mendeley provides 2GB free Cloud syncing storage, and the folder monitoring and files/folders automation can save much time.

The reason why to ditch Mendeley and go for Zotero, is that Mendeley decided to end the life of *Mendeley Desktop*, which is not possible to download after 1 Sep, 2022, and the new *Mendeley Reference Manager* is in fact a lite version with a few important functionalities being cut down.


After one-day's Zotero experience, I managed to make it work perfectly, especially for supporting $$\LaTeX$$ and generating the Google Scholar style ***citation keys***, e.g. *johan2022signal*, and I rename the linked pdf file name with “*johan2022signal processing in …”* to be consistent with the cite key, and be efficient for searching. The default Zotero renaming will put “et. al” after the author names which I think is not necessary and make the file name less concise.


## Useful Zotero plugins
For $$\LaTeX$$ lovers, it is better to install the following plugins:

- [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
- [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com)

### How to install plugins

- Download the plugin installation files.
- Go to "Zotero\Tools\Add-ons\", click the gear icon on the upper right.
- Install Add-on From File:

## Choose between Mendeley and Zotero
> Absolutely, as comparing any other digital products, there is no absolute answer about which is better between Mendeley and Zotero.

- Mendeley is better for beginners, if you don’t want to customize the Cloud syncing, just let Mendeley do everything for you with the 2GB storage, because 300MB free space in Zotero is too small, you need to upgrade the storage if using Zotero file syncing.
- Zotero is good for advanced users who like $$\LaTeX$$, and want to customize own Cloud syncing, e.g. with Dropbox, and make own styles of cite keys, naming conventions, etc. Need to read carefully about the [Zotero syncing](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync) documentation, otherwise, there is a risk that the database will be corrupted if simply set the Zotero storage path in any Cloud Drive.
