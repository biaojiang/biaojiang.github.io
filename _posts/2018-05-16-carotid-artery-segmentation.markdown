## Carotid artery segmentation

Use [image segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) techniques to detect the plaque, find the boundaries and do delineating for further texture feature analysis.

## Method

One app was developed with some Python programming techniques using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org), [Scipy](https://scipy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), it is convenient to segment the region of interest.

## Result

The following result shows the carotid artery plaque segmentation results, other analysis like SD (standard deviation), CV ([coefficient of variation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation)), GSM (grayscale median), etc.
