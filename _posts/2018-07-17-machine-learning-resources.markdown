## Open-source packages

Personally, I prefer the following Python packages:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

TensorFlow was developed by Google Brain team AI researchers and engineers, supporting CPUs, GPUs, TPUs. Google's proprietary TPU is the future AI computing platform. So, for long-term considerations, TensorFlow is the best choice for ML and DL.
 
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.orgturi)

Being supported by Facebook, PyTorch has good compatibility with Numpy, and it provides strong tensor computations and dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU accelerations.

PyTorch is more conveniently to use than TensorFlow.

* [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate)

Turi Create was sponsored by Apple, if familiar with Mac OS, then Turi Create is much easier to code and export models to CoreML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps.

## Databases for training
