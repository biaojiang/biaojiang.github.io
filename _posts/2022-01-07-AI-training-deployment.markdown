:sparkles: Here are the collections of my machine learning (ML) and AI training and deployments.

## Streamlit Apps

[streamlit](https://streamlit.io) turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. 
All in Python, which is good for Python lovers.

### Apps

1. [Iris classification](https://share.streamlit.io/biaojiang/demoai/main/test_iris.py). It is a first test by taking some codes from someone's post, with `plotly` replaced with `matplotlib`, and the app code will be updated later.
`requirements.txt` is important, otherwise, there will be compiling errors.


> Streamlit is nice for fast model deploying. However, the price is a little bit expensive.
